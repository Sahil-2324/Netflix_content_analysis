# Netflix Content Gap Analysis
## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Netflix Content Gap Analysis workflow using Python, MySQL, and Power BI/Tableau.
The main objective is to clean and transform raw Netflix data, perform SQL-based gap analysis to identify underrepresented content, and present key findings in an interactive dashboard.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python (Pandas)** → Data cleaning and preprocessing

- **SQL (MySQL)** → Content distribution analysis, gap identification, trend analysis

- **Power BI** → Interactive dashboards for visualization
  
# 🔹 Step 1: CSV Raw and Cleaned Dataset

➡️ Data:  raw_dataset.csv
          undated_netflix_titles.csv

# 🔹 Step 2: Python (Data Cleaning)
Raw Netflix data was cleaned using Python (Pandas):

Handled missing values
Standardized date formats
Cleaned text fields (director, cast, country)

➡️ Script: data_cleaned.ipynb

# 🔹 Step 3: SQL (Gap Analysis)
MySQL was used for comprehensive content analysis:

Content distribution by type and genre
Regional content gaps
Release trends and content freshness
Rating and duration analysis

➡️ SQL Scripts: mysql.sql

# 🔹 Step 4: Dashboard (Interactive Visualization)
The final findings were presented in an interactive dashboard:

Content Type Distribution (Movies vs TV Shows)
Top Genres and Underrepresented Categories
Year Content Growth
Release Year Trends
Rating Distribution
Top Countries
